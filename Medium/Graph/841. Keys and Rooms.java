/*
There are n rooms labeled from 0 to n - 1 and all the rooms are locked except for room 0. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.

When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.

Given an array rooms where rooms[i] is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room i, return true if you can visit all the rooms, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.
We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.
We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.
We then visit room 3.
Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.
Example 2:

Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]
Output: false
Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.
 

Constraints:

n == rooms.length
2 <= n <= 1000
0 <= rooms[i].length <= 1000
1 <= sum(rooms[i].length) <= 3000
0 <= rooms[i][j] < n
All the values of rooms[i] are unique.

            int node = stack.pop(); // Get the next key 'node'
            for (int nei: rooms.get(node)) // For every key in room # 'node'...

                    stack.push(nei); // add the key to the todo list
                }
        }

/*
Time Complexity: O(N + E)O(N+E), where NN is the number of rooms, and EE is the total number of keys.

Space Complexity: O(N)O(N) in additional space complexity, to store stack and seen.
