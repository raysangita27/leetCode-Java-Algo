/*
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
Example 2:

Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.

/*
Recursive preorder traversal is extremely simple: follow Root->Left->Right direction, i.e. do all the business with the node (= update the current number and root-to-leaf sum), and then do the recursive calls for the left and right child nodes.

P.S. Here is the difference between preorder and the other DFS recursive traversals. On the following figure the nodes are numerated in the order you visit them, please follow 1-2-3-4-5 to compare different DFS strategies implemented as recursion.
